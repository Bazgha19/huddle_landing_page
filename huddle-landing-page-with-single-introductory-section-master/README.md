### What I learned

I learned about flexbox, which is really very helpful. I'll recommend to try it out to make your design responsive.

I want to continue focusing on flexbox concepts. I found flexbox very useful so I want to refine and perfect.

**Grid System**

### Useful resources

- [Grid system](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me for making two columns in a grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
